## How to use/summon the drawdogs

1. You need to use [the Macaroni edition](https://macaroni.chicory.pizza) of the game (needed to use custom scripts), check the website if you haven’t done it yet
2. Download [the script](https://github.com/chicory-pizza/objCustomDog/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it
3. Open and run [UndertaleModTool](https://github.com/krzys-h/UndertaleModTool/releases)
4. On UndertaleModTool, open `macaroni.win` inside the game folder
5. Click Scripts > Run other script...
6. Find and select `AddObjCustomDog.csx`
7. Select the `Scripts` folder when prompted
8. Save

Custom dogs are now ready to use! [Use the level editor](https://data.chicory.pizza/level/0_0_0) to insert the custom dogs.

[AddObjCustomDog.csx is open-sourced on GitHub](https://github.com/chicory-pizza/objCustomDog) and [licensed under GPL v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), same as UndertaleModTool.

For the GML scripts, I would have chosen a free license, however as they are technically based from the game (which is not open-source), I don’t feel it’s appropriate to put a license.
